#KNN based prediction
#This is a wearable system for predicting the freezing of gait in people affected by Parkinson's disease.
#This uses a machine learning-based approach that classifies accelerometer data from PD patients to anticipate the Freezing of Gait (FoG) occurrence in advance. 
#The FoG is an episodic gait disturbance affecting locomotion in Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
